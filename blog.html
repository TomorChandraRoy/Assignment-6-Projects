            <p><span class="text-lg font-semibold underline">The scope of var, let, and const is discussed below:</span><br> <br> <span class="text-lg font-semibold">var:  </span> var variables are function-scoped, which means they can be accessed in the function where they are declared and in any nested functions.</p><br><span class="text-lg font-semibold">let:  </span>let variables are block-scoped, which means they can only be accessed in the block where they are declared.</p><br><span class="text-lg font-semibold">const:  </span> const variables are also block-scoped, but they cannot be reassigned once they are declared.</p> <br>
            <h3  class="text-2xl font-medium">Null and undefined use cases are called ?</h3>
            <p><span class="text-lg font-semibold underline">Answer:</span><br>1. null can be used to make a value intentionally unspecified. For example, you can use null to make a function return no value.</p><br><p>2. undefined can be used to make a value unintentionally undefined. For example, you can declare a variable but not initialize it with a value.</p> <br>
            <h3  class="text-2xl font-medium">What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
            <p><span class="text-lg font-semibold underline">What I mean by REST API is:</span><br>REST API is the design principle of a web service, where resources are identified by unique URLs and data and state are transferred between users and servers via the HTTP protocol. REST APIs typically manage resources with standard HTTP methods (eg GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and use view media such as JSON or XML to represent resources.</p>
